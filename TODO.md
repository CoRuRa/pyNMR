##TODO list

Incomplete and not in order of improtance, but we have to stat somewhere:

 - [ ] comment the code a bit more

 - [ ] docstrings - more of them, longer, more informative

 - [ ] examples - create a folder with example ipython notebooks

 - [ ] tests - write some unit tests so we can confirm that the sofrware works as expected 

 - [ ] background - write a method to create a background spectrum that can then be subtracted from the exeperimental one (e.g. in integration)
